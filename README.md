## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge i've learned how to build a simple and interactive notifications UI with basic HTML5, CSS e JS knowledgments.   

### Continued development

I'm not completely comfortable with building UIs, so for continued development i'll continue to study HTML and CSS and do more challenges like this one to refine and perfect my habilities on bulding UIs

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with CSS Flexbox. I'll continue to use it  and i'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept
